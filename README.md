# MoleculeReader
This project uses C to create a library, which is then imported into Python. Python is used to integrate SQL and launch a site on your local host browser.
This was a project I coded during the course Software System Development and Integration at the University of Guelph.
#To Run:
in a terminal python3 server.py 59798.
To view once it is launched, go to localhost:59798 in a browser.
A properly formatted SDF file must be inputted to view a molecule properly.
